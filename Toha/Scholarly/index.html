      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        In this document we can find information about the pattern designs used in the wireframes and prototypes when creating the design for the project named Toha.

      <h2>Introduction-Scope</h2>
        <p>
            Toha is designed to be an app that assits the user to plan and take part in trips by providing directions to points of interest that are nearby, to abillity 
            to plan your own trip and to join trips that have already been planned

      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>
        We tried to analyze each persona case and to understand their goals, needs and difficulties, in order to make our application as good as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We thought about what scenarios our application would be helpful in. We expanded on this in the persona.html by going in detail for each of the personas 
        described.
      </p>
      <section id="perspective">
        <h3>Primary</h3>
        <p>
            The primary persona is Matei Burlacu. He is a tourisitic guide that wants to use the application in order to help him with his job.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="perspective">
        <h3>Secondary</h3>
        <p>
            A secondary persona is Mihaela Balan, a young woman that likes to quickly plan trips with friends and does so with ease.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="perspective">
        <h3>Secondary 2</h3>
        <p>
            Another secondary persona is Alexandra Ursu, a deaf woman. She wants to travel independently, but her disabilty is an obstacle.
        </p>
      </section><section id="perspective">
        <h3>Served</h3>
        <p>
            A served persona is Ionut Lupu. He is a middle aged man that likes to take trips and wants to do so quickly.

      <h2>Story boards</h2>
      <p>
        We made some sketches while imagining the scenarios described in the personas.html file. There are 2 drawings, one illustrating the experience of a guide, and one illustrating the the experience of a tourist.
      </p>
      <br><br><br>

        In the image above we can see how an user might want to use this app as a guide.

        In this image we can see how an user could use the app in order to join a trip made by a guide.

      <img src=".\Userflow2.jpg" alt="descriptive text" width=100% height = 100%>
      <p>
        In the userflows made above we can see how an user logs into the app. After they log in they can see the dashboard, where they can do a multitude of actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open the chat, from which they can select a conversation or go back;</li>
        <li>Open the menu, from which they can open a category or go back;</li>
        <li>They can start planning a trip;</li>
        <li>They can browse existing tours;</li>
        <li>They can log out.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>For our application, we wanted to keep everything simple and to have continous seeming flows when performing something.</p>
      <section id="perspective">
        <h3>Mobile</h3>
        <p>
          For example, when trying to search for a tour, you only need to follow one path. Search -> Browse tours -> Select tour -> Join tour -> Back home.
        </p>
        <p>For the UI patterns, we chose to keep it simple. We have an upper menu bar which has 3 functional elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A burger menu, which is the main mean of navigation for anything you're looking for;</li>
          <li>A search bar that has adaptive results based on what screen you are on (for chats, it displays people, for main screen, it displays cities, tours, monuments, etc);</li>
          <li>A notification bell for updates in your tours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The burger menu leads to a list of options, ordered by how often we think something might be used.
          At the bottom of the screen there is a permanent chat bubble, for accessing the chats screen that also displays message notifications.
          For actions and commands, we mainly illustrated the user controlling the application by pressing buttons on the screen.
          There is also the option for speech to text search and the ability to view P.O.I.s through 360 view.</p>
          <br><br><br>

          <img src=".\Sketch2.jpg" alt="descriptive text" width=100% height = 100%>
          <img src=".\Sketch3.jpg" alt="descriptive text" width=100% height = 100%>
      </section>
      <section id="perspective">
        <h3>Web</h3>
        <p> For web we just adapted the "frame" of the application.
          We have an upper menu bar, which has all the functionalities it had on the mobile application.
          Now the burger menu opens a drop down list, as the web platform has more display space.
          We also added a quick log out function for the ease of accesibility.
          The chat now is permanentely displayed as a list in the right side of the screen and opened chats replace this section.
          Other than that, the main area is in the center of the screen, containing the adapted screens from the mobile application.
          The actions are the same as in the mobile application.</p>

    <section id="description" role="doc-introduction">
      <h2>Prototypes</h2>
      <p>For Figma, we pretty much followed the sketches exactly as they are.
        Additionaly, we implemented the screens we didn't bother to sketch as we considered them basic and standardized (the settins, chat, etc.)
        We also searched for clear icons for each functionality (bell for notifications, bubble speech for chat, some kind of camera for VR, with the label 360*).
        After everything was put in place, we created the flows in Figma for everything we planned.</p>

<h2 class="marginalizat text_format" id="chapter0">The apps</h2>

<p class="marginalizat text_format">For this challange we chose the following apps:</p>
<ul class="marginalizat text_format">
	<li class="discord">
	<p><b>Discord</b><br><br>Discord is a VoIP and instant messaging social platform. 
		Users have the ability to communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, 
		media and files in private chats or as part of communities called "servers".</p>
	</li>
	<li class="messenger">
	<p><b>Messenger</b><br><br>Messenger is a proprietary instant messaging app and platform developed by Meta Platforms. Originally developed as Facebook Chat in 2008, the company revamped its messaging service in 2010.</p>
	</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="marginalizat text_format" id="chapter1">Affordances, visual variables and interaction flows</h2>

<h3 class="marginalizat text_format">Affordances</h3>
<p class="marginalizat text_format">The hints that the product/device offers in order to help us realise how it should be used: in a layout we have buttons with labels.<br>
	An example for our day to day life is the following: the existence of a doorknob tells us that that object can be opened </p>
<ul class="marginalizat text_format">
	<li class="discord">
		<p><b>Discord</b><br><br>The first experience offers some hints. The first thing we see is the option to join a public community (server) or to create your own.<br><br>
		The landing page's main function is to search a friend in case you want to start communicating with another user.<br><br>
		In case the user is confused, in the top right corner there is a "help" button that redirects to a FAQ page with more information and the option to search 
		for the problem you met.
		</p>
		<center><img class="img_orizontal" src="https://i.imgur.com/xn5uUg8.png"></center>
		<center><img class="img_orizontal" src="https://i.imgur.com/C0GAZvv.png"></center>
		<center><img class="img_orizontal" src="https://i.imgur.com/nR097AK.png"></center>
		<center><img class="img_orizontal" src="https://i.imgur.com/sHHnKno.png"></center>
		<center><img class="img_orizontal" src="https://i.imgur.com/BVrH8IH.png"></center>
	</li>
	<li class="messenger">		
		<p><b>Messenger</b><br><br>For a new user, the interface is completely empty and it's pretty difficult to know what to do.<br><br>
		For a user that already has a few friends, the main functions (chat, calls) are intuitive and clear<br><br>
		</p>
		<center><img class="img_orizontal" src="https://i.imgur.com/0lGbjcH.png"></center>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="marginalizat text_format">Visual variables</h3>
<p class="marginalizat text_format">
	A visual variable is an aspect of a graphical object that can visually differentiate it from other objects, 
	and can be controlled during the design process.<br>
	Those variables consist of: position, size, shape, colour, orientation and texture.
</p>
<ul class="marginalizat text_format">
	<li class="discord">
		<p><b>Discord</b><br><br>
		Usually, all the visual elements are well differentiated, organised in clear and persistent sections.<br>
		For example:
		</p>
		<center><img class="img_orizontal" src="https://i.imgur.com/Dwo91K6.png"></center>
		<center><img class="img_vertical" src="https://i.imgur.com/M9sqnZ9.png"></center>
		<p>
		Servers are always round icons placed on the left side of the screen in a vertical list that has a dark shade of grey.<br><br>
		Then there is another vertical list that has a lighter shade of grey where:<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are on a server's window, we can observe communication channels, graphically identified as voice/text channels accompanied by their name.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are on the direct messages window, we can observe the friend's list made form the user's profile picture and their name.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excepting the vertical orientation and the position on the screen, those differences are easy to spot.<br><br>		
		After this we have the main area that represents the chat room we have selected.<br>
		Besides those there are other sections that are sepparated just as well.<br>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li class="messenger">		
		<p><b>Messenger</b><br><br>
		On the mobile app, we only have acces to a single view, therefore there no ambiguity is present between sections.<br>
		On the desktop/web app we have, just like Discord, 3 main sections.<br>
		This time they are not differentiated trough colour, but trough borders.<br><br>
		First we have a main menu from which we can acces different chat categories that are illustrated trough icons:<br><br>				
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Normal chats <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Chats with currently <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Marketplace chats<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Chat requests<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Archives <br><br>
		It's fairly easy to determine in what section you are since the title of the next section changes accordingly.<br>
		Then we have the chat section: a vertical list with every conversation, where we have the user's profile pic, name and the last messege.<br>
		Then we have the main section: the chat.
		</p>
		<center><img class="img_orizontal" src="https://i.imgur.com/0lGbjcH.png"></center>
		<center><img class="img_vertical" src="https://i.imgur.com/zp55Xx4.png"></center>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="marginalizat text_format">Interaction flows</h3>
<p class="marginalizat text_format">An interaction flow refers to the sequence of actions or steps that a user takes to accomplish a specific task or goal.</p>
<ul class="marginalizat text_format">
	<li class="discord">
		<p><b>Discord</b><br><br>			
		Usually, any flow is intuitive and it's not formed from too many steps (around 5 steps for anything).<br><br>
		An example would be when an user receives a notification in a text channel. 
		First the task bar icon receives a pip, then, if the messege is from a server, a white pip appears next to the server, and the channel 
		where the messege is sent has a bold font and white colour.<br><br>
		Also, the user cna use the inbox to see unread messeges.<br><br>
		</p>

		<center><img class="img_orizontal" style="width:40%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/BO0ccep.png"></center>
	</li>
	<li class="messenger">		
		<p><b>Messenger</b><br><br>
		Any flow that is related to communication is intuitive and simple. dar anything that has to do with the account(changing a password) 
		depends on Facebook, which requires additional steps.<br><br>
		We will follow a simillar flow for messenger.
		When an user receives a message, they get a pip in the taskbar. In the contacts list(the one that sent the message appears at the top of the list) 
		the username is highlighted in bold.

<h2 class="marginalizat text_format" id="chapter2">Visual metaphors, idioms and text-only interaction</h2>

<h3 class="marginalizat text_format">Visual metaphors and idioms</h3>
<p class="marginalizat text_format">
	There are multiple simillarities between the two apps.<br><br>
	They both are sepparated in 3 sections.<br><br>
	The icons they use are generic (a phone for voicalls, a videocamera for video calls, a magnifying glass to search a message, etc.).<br><br>
	An exception is that on the web/desktop apps Messenger has a button to send a message while Discord doesn't have this button.
</p>
<center><img class="img_orizontal" style="width:30%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/F7KQ8Bs.png"></center>
<center><img class="img_orizontal" style="width:30%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/Iu1Rddc.png"></center>

<h3 class="marginalizat text_format">Text-only interaction</h3>
<p class="marginalizat text_format">We will take into consideration the sections describet previously and the base functionalities for this excercise.
</p>
<ul class="marginalizat text_format">
	<li class="discord">
		<p><b>Discord</b><br><br></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>The server, channels and friends list can be represented trough a structure simillar to documents on a Windows command prompt.</p>
				<p class="command_line">
					ls servers<br>
					cd name_server<br><br>
					
					ls name_server<br>
					cd name_channel<br>
					read messages<br>
					write message<br><br>
					
					ls friends<br>
					cd name_friend<br>
					read messages<br>
					write message
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					During a call we have the following options: mute, deafen, share screen, close call.<br>
					If you're on a server you have to acess a voice channel.<br><br>
					On the command line, after entering a conversation with another user, we can use the following commands:
				</p>
				<p class="command_line">
					start video_call<br>
					start voice_call<br>
					join_call<br>
					reject_call<br>
					exit_call<br>
					deafen me<br>
					mute me<br>
					mute user<br>
				</p>
				<p>For servers, from the channels list we can chose a voice channel where we can use the following commands:</p>
				<p class="command_line">
					join channel<br>
					exit channel<br>
					mute me<br>
					mute user<br>
					deafen me<br>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li class="messenger">		
		<p><b>Messenger</b><br><br>Being a simillar app, we will apply the same implementation for a command line app.<br><br>
		An exception is that Messenger doesn't have servers, but it has groups. But those groups are more simillar to a normal conversation.<br>
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="marginalizat text_format" id="chapter3">Cognitive overload</h2>
<p class="marginalizat text_format"></p>
<ul class="marginalizat text_format">
	<li class="discord">
		<p><b>Discord</b><br><br>
			An example for a cognitive overload is that there can be servers with a big channel number that aren't grouped, which can make finding the right channel 
			difficult.<br><br>
			Also, if there are a lot of users in a voice channel, communication is difficult.
		</p>

<h2 class="marginalizat text_format" id="chapter5">Empiric laws</h2>

<h3 class="marginalizat text_format">Fitts'</h3>
<p class="marginalizat text_format">Fitts' law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target.Thus, the longer the distance and the smaller the target’s size, the longer it takes.
</p>
<ul class="marginalizat text_format">
	<li class="discord">
		<p><b>Discord</b><br><br>Overall, Discord's elements are small and distant.<br>
			Example: to call a friend, we must open the conversation and then press on the call icon.Those buttons are sitting on opposite ends of the window.<br><br>
			The menus are positioned on the edge of the window on the Web/Desktop version.<br>
			On the mobile version we need to swipe, then press on the profile icon from where we can access settings.<br>
		</p>
		<center><img class="img_orizontal" src="https://i.imgur.com/QMITEJA.png"></center>
	</li>
	<li class="messenger">		
		<p><b>Messenger</b><br><br>Messenger has a very similar case to discord, where the buttons are sitting on opposite sides and the icons are fairly small, but they are a bit bigger than Discord's.
		</p>
		<center><img class="img_orizontal" src="https://i.imgur.com/UYCsI1t.png"></center>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="marginalizat text_format">Hick's</h3>
<p class="marginalizat text_format">Hick's law describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time.
</p>
<ul class="marginalizat text_format">
	<li class="discord">
		<p><b>Discord</b><br><br>
		Discord's settings are placed in a single view. Those are sepaprated in multiple categories(User settings, Billing settings, etc.), that also have 
		subdivisions, from which you access multiple settings.<br><br>
		Even if they are well divided, there are a few ambiguities between categories and they are visually differentiated.

<h3 class="marginalizat text_format">Steering</h3>
<p class="marginalizat text_format">The steering law is a predictive model of human movement that describes the time required to navigate, or steer, 
through a 2-dimensional tunnel. The tunnel can be thought of as a path or trajectory on a plane that has an associated thickness or width, 
where the width can vary along the tunnel. The goal of a steering task is to navigate from one end of the tunnel to the other as quickly as possible, 
without touching the boundaries of the tunnel.
</p>
<p class="marginalizat text_format">
Both apps have short tunnels. Approximately 4 or 5 sections.<br><br>
Example: Openning settings
